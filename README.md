# holbertonschool-files_manager


This project is a summary of the second back-end trimester: authentication, NodeJS, MongoDB, Redis, pagination and background processing.

The objective is to build a simple platform to upload and view files:

* User authentication via a token
* List all files
* Upload a new file
* Change permission of a file
* View a file
* Generate thumbnails for images

Of course, this kind of service already exists in the real life - itâ€™s a learning purpose to assemble each piece and build a full product.

## Learning Objectives
* how to create an API with Express
* how to authenticate a user
* how to store data in MongoDB
* how to store temporary data in Redis
* how to setup and use a background worker
